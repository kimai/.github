## Hey, this is Kimai - the open source time-tracker 👋

We’ve been doing this since **2009**. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed **thousands of commits** and yes, we rebuilt Kimai once again from scratch in **2017** (something we do not plan to do ever again). But that's just us. We are happy to know that we are helping thousands of companies and freelancers across the solar system 🪐 with their (project) time-tracking workflows.

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of Kimai and fundamental to how we build software today.

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. 
You don't have have to be a software developer. We need more: translations, bug reports 🪲, feature requests, discussions, documentation and people spreading the word 📢
